# Nietypowa Sowa

## About

I would like to introduce you to one of my website commercial projects, where I built the whole thing using the React framework.

Nietypowa-Sowa is a website dedicated to an artist who works extensively in the art of painting and drawing. To build it, I used a mockup created by my designer [Julia Hyz](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/julia-hyz-098288274), who also helped me to create my own [portfolio-page](https://konrad-wojtylo.com/). The website allows you to browse the offer and contact via a form using a friendly UI.

## Coding & Problems

I did not encounter any major problems when writing the code due to the use of components from the previous project and the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) library. What was new for me, however, was the use of useParams to display specific data.

The code is refactored and divided into components and custom hooks.
